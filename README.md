# Introductory Quantum Programming using Rigetti Forest and Grove
<br>
Notebooks exploring various features of the Rigetti Forest &amp; Grove using pyQuil<br>

Please check out the [reference material](https://github.com/markf94/rigetti_training_material) from Rigetti's training session at the Creative Destruction Lab for Quantum Machine Learning 2018 batch. The reference notebooks contain detailed instructions for installing necessary modules before exploring [pyQuil](https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Grove](https://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). <br>

The following is the expected sequence of exploring the notebooks but feel free to look around the Notebooks folder before leaping into a particular one.
* Intro to Quil
* Gates and Wavefunctions
* Universal Gates and Shallow Circuits in Grove
* Variational Quantum Eigensolver

P.S. This is a work in progress and more notebooks get added and existing ones updated as and when I explore advanced features of Grove. So keep checking back for updates.
